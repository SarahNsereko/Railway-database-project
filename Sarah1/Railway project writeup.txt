Assumptions:
a)Payment and booking were done physically 
b)All passengers can only book a maximum of 5 seats 
c)All passengers are restricted to a maximum of 5 bags 
d)The amount paid depends on the number of seats booked by a passenger
e)A train can travel to a given destination at different times on different dates or at different times to a given distination on the same date 
f) Every train has a set off and arrival time 
g) One passenger is given only one ticket summarizing the data of the seats they have booked and number of bags and amount they have paid

Special Case:
The train numbers are like a number plate for the trains .
passengers can travel using the same train at different times and dates
Because of this the train number is repeated many times and so we generated a unique id to identify the train in different scenarios .

The station numbers are used to identify the stations but since they were also repeated  due to different passengers using the same station we created a unique station_id To identify the station used in different scenarios like station used on different dates and so on


The schema diagram has two pages one showing the connections in plain text and one showing the connections in highlighted text
